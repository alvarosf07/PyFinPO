# Portfolio Optimization Solvers (Optimizers)
The solver implemented to address the optimization problem in the previous examples has been implemented under the hood of the ``MeanVariancePO`` class, which inherits its methods from the ``BaseConvexOptimizer`` class. In the context of Mean-Variance theory, as the optimization problem is typically convex (unless non-convex constraints or objectives are introduced), it can be solved via quadratic programming with the [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) python library for convex optimization.

While Mean-Variance optimization framework can be addressed with convex optimization, other portfolio optimization models which are completely different in character may use different optimization schemes. An overall summary is presented below for quick reference, including only the main portfolio optimization models and the optimization solver they use in this library.
