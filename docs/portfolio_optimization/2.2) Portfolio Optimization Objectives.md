#### **Objective Functions**
Some of the Portfolio Optimization Models detailed in [PO Models](2.1\)%20Portfolio%20Optimization%20Models.md) are self-descriptive, in the sense that by definition they only posses a single possible objective function to optimize. In these cases, the default objective function will be automatically chosen by the code implementation, and the user will not need to specify any objective.

However, there are other models (the most obvious kind being Mean-Risk models) which allow to select different objective functions to optimize for. The easiest way to picture this behavior is with Mean-Variance theory as an example (see Figure 2). Within the MVT framework we can define the Efficient Frontier, which represents a Pareto Optimal set of possible optimal portfolios.For a given Efficient Frontier, different points can be selected as optimal under different objective functions. 

In this context, ``PyFinPO`` provides five main objective functions:
- **Minimum Risk** - ``global_min_risk``
    - Represents the point of the Optimal Set with lowest level of risk. Its calculation can be useful to have an idea of how low risk could be for a given problem/portfolio.
- **Minimize Risk** - ``min_risk``
    - Minimizes risk for a given level of return.
- **Maximize Return** - ``max_return`` 
    - Minimizes return for a given level of risk.
- **Maximize Ratio** - ``max_ratio`` 
    - Maximizes the ratio return-risk for the whole portfolio. This returns the tangency portfolio, as it represents the point on a returns-risk graph where the tangent to the efficient frontier intersects the y-axis at the risk-free rate. This is the default choice as it finds the optimal return per level of risk at portfolio level.
- **Maximize Utility** - ``max_return`` 
    - Maximizes the utility function provided manually by the user, which specifies its level of risk aversion.

Once again, the word "risk" can be replaced for any of the available risk metrics defined under ``MeanRiskPO`` class (see list above).

> _Note: not all of these objective functions may be available for all the different Mean-Risk models._

#### **Adding Custom Objectives**
In addition, sometimes we may want to add extra optimization objectives that are not defined in the previous 5 objective functions.

``PyFinPO`` supports the addition of extra optimization objectives. Note that there are 2 types of objectives, convex and non-convex. While convex objectives fit nicely under a convex optimization solver, non-convex objectives may be treated with care as they may produce incompatibilities with the solvers implemented in this library.

- **Convex Objectives:**
    - L2 regularisation (minimising this reduces nonzero weights)
    - Transaction cost model (can be added also as constraint)
    - Custom convex objectives (must be expressed with ``cvxpy`` [atomic functions](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/functions/index.html))
    
- **Non-Convex Objectives:**
    - See example in the original docs of the PyPortOpt library [here](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt/blob/master/cookbook/3-Advanced-Mean-Variance-Optimisation.ipynb)

#### Single-Objective vs Multi-Objective Optimization
Note that when we provide an specific objective function or set of objectives for the portfolio optimization, it will return a single solution (i.e. single set of optimal weights that represent the optimal portfolio).

Alternatively, we can change our approach and implement a multi-objective optimization where we obtain an optimal set of solutions from which we can choose the preferred one for our objectives. A way to do this, is by plotting the optimal set of solutions (e.g. efficient frontier in case of Mean-Variance Theory) and then choosing the desired portfolio.
