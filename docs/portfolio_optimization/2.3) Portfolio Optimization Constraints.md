# Portfolio Optimization Constraints
Constraints and objectives are treated similarly from an optimization point of view. Therefore, the methodology to add constraints to a portfolio optimization is almost equivalent to the process of adding objectives described above. 

The main portfolio optimization constraints available in ``PyFinPO`` are:
 
 - **Market Neutrality**

 - **Long/Short Portfolio**
 
 - **Weight Bounds** (limit the position size of securities)
 
 - **Sector & Security Constraints**
 
 - **Score Constraints**

 - **NÂº of Asset Constraints** (Convexity Constraints)

 - **Tracking Error Constraints**
